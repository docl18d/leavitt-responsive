          <p>At the bakery (Boulangerie) "Paul" across the Street from the Paris Catacombs.  My wife Lorie took the Picture.  We had a private tour of the Catacombs and had some time to kill before the tour.  We had chocolate eclars and coffee. This was June of 2019.  Prior to the tour (and the eclair and coffee) we visited to the west of Paris to see the Chateau de Versailles.  This is where King's Louis the XIII, XiV, and XVI all lived during their reign, or at least had their offices.  Also on the grounds is the Grand Trianon Palace.  This is where Queen Marie-Antoinette lived as the Queen of France, wife of King Louis the XVI.  Also on the grounds but about a mile away from the Grand Trianon is the Petit Trianon.  This is where King XVI lived with his mistress Comtess du Berry.  These are all tied together witha magnificently groomed gardens and a massive Royal Way (lake).  It was impossible to walk directly to the Trionans from The Chateau as you had to follow groomed paths in the trees.  It took almost an hour to walk to the Trionan, every stepp of the way on groomed paths among the trees. </p>

          <p>The next day we took the Chunnel train to London.  Very nice but somewhat boring ride.  London was great.  We hit Buskingham Palace (saw the changing of the guards), Westminister Palace and Chapel, and Abby, Big Ben (under repairs), and Trafalgar Square.  we took a cab to the oldest part of london and had lunch.  Then we went to see the building where Sweeney Todds Barber shop once was.  As legends go, Sweeny Todd murdered some of his foreign customers who attended college near by. He did it with a straight razor and turned their bodies over to Mrs. Lovett, his partner in crime, who bakes their flesh into meat pies. Then they sold the meat pies.  Finally for me, we took a cab to 70 Grovsvener St.  That was where the headquarters of the Office of Stretegic Service (OSS) were located during World War 2.  We then walked to a subay and caught the tube back to St Pancras Station.  Massive train station but that is where you catch the train back and forth between London and Paris.</P>

          <p>The next day was my day.  We caught the train out of Paris and rode to Carentan.  From there we took a taxi to St Mere Eglise.  During World War 2 the 2nd Battalion of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment jump into there on D-Day.  That was the same unit I was in from 1990 to 1992.  One Paratrooper got hung up on the church steeple.  His name was John Steele.  There is a great movie about this called "The Longest Day.  The main hotel (auberge) in St Mere Eglise is called Auberge John Steele.  I had mad reservetions there and my Wife and I had a rather pricey Seven Course meal there.  It was a historic day when we were there.  It was June 6, 2019....75 year anniversery of D-Day.  The place was packed.  One the way back we had time to kill again so we stopped at small bar in Carentan.  Then we walked around the town.  They have pizza ATM's there.  It works just like an ATm.  You put your card in, punsh which type of pizza, and it comes out a slot five minutes later.</p>
            
          <p>The next day we went to the Louve.  It was incredible.  I must say though....the Mona Lisa was rather small.  It is only about 2 1/2 feet by 2 feet.  However I loved seeing the Code of hamurabbi.  The first ever written law for a society written by the Babylonians in 1754 B.C.  It was actually chisseled into a diorite stone stele (tall round stone) about 7 feet tall and looks like the shape of an index finger. There were so many incredible things.  But my absolite favorite was the Winged Victory of Samothrace.  absolutely majectic.  After the Lovre we walked holding hands along the Siene River until we got to the Eiffel Tower.  To b honest, it was a little but of a llet down.  Long lines and very crowded.  But we got to see it.  We took a train from there to the Chatelet Stop and walked to Notr Dame Cathedral.  This was about a month and a half after it caught fire.  While it was severly damaged, it was still very cool to see.</p> 

          <p>That night we ate out again. We actually did that for all our meals.  We stayed in a very nice place in the 14th Arrondissement (district) of Paris.  We enjoyed just walking the streets and night, sitting in an outside cafe, having a nice wine or coffee.  Most mornings we had a great buffett style french breakfast.  When we didnt have time, we had fresh croissants in the hotel lobby every morning as well as great coffee.  The following day we flew Home.  We had planned on going to Romania this year but the pandemic stopped all that.</p>
